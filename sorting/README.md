# Sorting Program

## Program Description
This program contains multiple sorting algorithms all configurably runnable. When executed with proper arguments in the command line, this program will generate a random array of length 25 and the selected sorting algorithms will run. <br>

NOTE: A later objective of this project is to display the sorting algorithm in action by printing all the changes to it. Due to the potential size and readability of such a thing, more research will need to be done in order to display this information in a clean, readable manner.
